Each agent provided responses that had strengths and weaknesses. We need you to do a review of the original prompt to characterize the input context, then then do a critical review of each agent’s response. Provide your review in a single comprehensive analysis in markdown format. Evaluate each response for gaps in the logic, assumptions, mis-alignment with the intended objective. Note that the design of the end system must be as simple as possible while achieving the intended objective/enabling the required capabilities. Identify any sources of unnecessary complexity or expansions in scope that would lead to bloat or excessive complexity.
output requirements:
	1.	Provide a single markdown formatted deliverable
	2.	Break the document into four sections, one for each agent’s analysis.
	3.	Provide a succinct (no more than 2-3 line) outline of the gap/failure you are addressing.
	4.	For each observation / finding, provide counterpoint / recommendations for improving or addressing the finding/observation. Again, it must be succinct and concise (fewer than 2-3lines)
	5.	be methodical in your approach. Go point by point through each deliverable.
